Here is the flow I want you to convert.  Make sure you don't just return the example flow to me.


```json
{flow_text}
```

I don't care about the example flow you were given, ONLY give me the SQL output for this flow.
If the model needs to be split up into multiple models, please split it up as multiple SQL outputs that reference one another.
Please format it as markdown and make sure all sql codeblocks are marked appropriately.
Also please try to put it into the correct folder structure I'm using.
